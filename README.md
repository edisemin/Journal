# Project Description
This is a group project which required the team to build a website which enabled users 
to visit a website and make anonymous post journal entries. Users have a limitation on 
how many characters they can put in an entry and can also add gifs. They can also view other 
people's entries as well as commenting and reacting to them with an emoji. 

The website can be viewed in this link:
