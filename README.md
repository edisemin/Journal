## Project Description
This is a group project which required the team to build a website that enabled users 
to visit and write anonymous blog posts and send GIFs. Users have a limitation on 
how many characters they can put in an entry. They can also view other 
people's entries or GIFs as well as comment and express their opinions with emojis. 

The website can be viewed at this link:
